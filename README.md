# Crack the Code Using Patterns 🚀

A curated collection of LeetCode solutions organized by problem-solving patterns (arrays, hashing, two pointers, sliding window, recursion, etc.), built with interview preparation in mind.

Problems are organized the way **IntelliJ + Java developers think**:  
**Pattern → Sub-Pattern → Individual Problems**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice solving LeetCode problems **using patterns instead of memorization**
- Build the habit of **thinking through edge cases and trade-offs**
- Maintain a clean, scalable structure suitable for **Java + IntelliJ projects**
- Keep a public log of consistent interview preparation

---

## 📁 Organization Philosophy

This repository is organized incrementally as problems are solved:

- Start with a **pattern**
- Refine understanding through **sub-patterns**
- Apply the pattern to individual LeetCode problems

The structure evolves naturally as more problems are added.

---

## 🛠 Language & Tools

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  

---

## 🧠 Interview Focus

The emphasis is on:
- Pattern recognition
- Sub-pattern mastery
- Handling edge cases
- Arriving at optimal solutions when applicable

This mirrors real interview expectations without unnecessary abstraction.

## 📌 Notes

This repository is actively evolving.  
Content and structure are added progressively alongside learning.
